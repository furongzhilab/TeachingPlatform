# TeachingPlatform
### Project introduction
"Master Teacher Enjoy" is a teaching platform for primary and middle schools with an interface that mimics Chinese university MOOC, netease cloud classroom, Cool Learning and other online education websites for primary and middle school students.

### Related technology
It uses **SpringBoot + Vue**  to separate the front and rear ends. The backend uses SpringBoot as the development framework and Vue as the front-end design. The project uses a MySQL database to store data.

Note: Before running Vue, install Node.js and set up the Vue environment.

Installation Node.js:
* Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/

* Win+R key to open CMD, enter node-v or npm -v, the version number appears, the installation is successful.
```
node-v
```
```
npm -v
```

* Install cnpm:

(Because some npm resources are blocked or foreign resources, it often fails to install dependencies with npm, so we also need the domestic mirror of npm--cnpm.)

In the CMD command line input
```
npm install -g CNPM -registry=http://registry.npm.taobao.org
```
After the installation is complete, we can use cnpm instead of npm to install the dependent packages.

* Upgrade NPM:
```
npm -g install npm@version_number
```

To be continued...
